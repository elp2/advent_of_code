# Advent of Code Solutions 2025

## Summary
Just 12 days this time, better than 0!

## Day 10
Some criminal z3 usage saved the day on part 2!

## Day 8
I missed it wasn't Manhattan distance! D'oh :P

## Day 7
Pretty easy again. No real 2d puzzles yet this year?

## Day 6
Handel's Messiah and then back home for AoC. Part 2 threw me because I was expecting it to be right aligned, rather than based on the actual padding of the input.
Looking at this again, it might have been much easier to just go up from the "+-" and then do the right thing to capture all the nums, and rest on the space?

## Day 5
Not pretty but it works! The most straightforward so far?

## Day 4
Oh man wasted a lot of time with the "fewer than four rolls of paper in the eight adjacent positions."... I thought it was about from the perspective of the forklift.
In fact the forklift was kind of a red herring. Final answer was kinda simple with just a queue.

## Day 3
Lazy cache and mp FTW.

## Day 2
Again, my AOC instincts said it was not going to be brute-forcable but it was!

## Day 1
Definitely harder than the normal Day 1. The second part was small enough that you could easily brute force it if you were still warming up on problems :)
