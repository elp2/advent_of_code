# Advent of Code Solutions 2025

## Summary
Just 12 days this time, better than 0!

## Day 3
Lazy cache and mp FTW.

## Day 2
Again, my AOC instincts said it was not going to be brute-forcable but it was!

## Day 1
Definitely harder than the normal Day 1. The second part was small enough that you could easily brute force it if you were still warming up on problems :)
