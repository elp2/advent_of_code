# Advent of Code Solutions 2024

## Day 4
Luckily we are not handling corruped memory IntCode (AOC 2019) style... yet.
Part 1 went pretty quickly, and I would have had Part 2 momentarily afterwards if I hadn't put down -1, -1 / 1, 1 as my delta... that was just comparing the same lines!!!

## Day 3
It's funny because I played around with the parse library this morning since I thought it could help avoid regex, but this one was so much easier to solve using findall!

## Day 2
For some reason this was way harder than it should have been.
I couldn't run the debugger, which made the problem worse. Had to rewrite in the morning to redeem myself and test my new tempalte changes.

## Day 1
Pretty easy, just easing back into my template.
