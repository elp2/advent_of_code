# Advent of Code Solutions 2024

## Day 14
My favorite one of the year so far. When I saw the prime number sizes, I thought we'd run to 10 million seconds or something, but this was a nice surprise.

## Day 13
The edge conditions for Part 1 were tricky for some reason. Maybe I was underestimating it. Part 2 was simple algebra.

## Day 12
The trick to Part 2 was to draw out the boxes and thought of what made a convex/concave corner.

## Day 11
I way overcomplicated Part 1 with a Linked List assuming the positions would matter in the second round. Then I had to rewrite Part 2 to use Counters. I should be using Counters over defaultdicts any time there are integer values!

## Day 10
The problem was a bit hard to parse, I overcomplicated it in the beginning. Part 2 was actually more natural in some ways than Part 1, since you could use a deque the whole way, rather than needing to dedupe the next set of items.

## Day 9
Not that hard, but in my defense I had some eggnog!

## Day 8
Python combinations made quick work of this one. Other than the antennas now being automatic antinodes of themselves on Part 2 the Part 1 solution was mostly good enough.

## Day 7
The easiest one this cycle by far.

## Day 6
The trickiest part was that the obstacles could be placed diagonally to each other, which resulted in a non 90 degree turn. 

## Day 5
Part 1 was pretty straightforward. Initially separating out the validation into a separate function would have made Part 2 faster.

## Day 4
Luckily we are not handling corruped memory IntCode (AOC 2019) style... yet.
Part 1 went pretty quickly, and I would have had Part 2 momentarily afterwards if I hadn't put down -1, -1 / 1, 1 as my delta... that was just comparing the same lines!!!

## Day 3
It's funny because I played around with the parse library this morning since I thought it could help avoid regex, but this one was so much easier to solve using findall!

## Day 2
For some reason this was way harder than it should have been.
I couldn't run the debugger, which made the problem worse. Had to rewrite in the morning to redeem myself and test my new tempalte changes.

## Day 1
Pretty easy, just easing back into my template.
