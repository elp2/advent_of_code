# 2022 Overview

I'm also trying these early questions in GPT Chat (after I finish them honestly myself!)

# Day 1
GPT Chat was very quick to write this.

# Day 2
I could not get GPT Chat to properly handle the rules grid. Maybe it would have been easier to convince it to add the chosen shape score rather than putting it in the state grid. It seemed pretty far away for Part 2 and Day 3 was about to start so I stopped trying to get it to work.

# Day 3
GPT worked great for part 1, once I told it to read from standard input. This actually even finished faster than my solution.
Part 2 seemed to be confused about the splitting lines up rule, but was grouping the lines properly.
