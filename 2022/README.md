# 2022 Overview

I'm also trying these early questions in GPT Chat (after I finish them honestly myself!)

# Day 1
GPT Chat was very quick to write this.

# Day 2
I could not get GPT Chat to properly handle the rules grid. Maybe it would have been easier to convince it to add the chosen shape score rather than putting it in the state grid. It seemed pretty far away for Part 2 and Day 3 was about to start so I stopped trying to get it to work.

# Day 3
GPT worked great for part 1, once I told it to read from standard input. This actually even finished faster than my solution.
Part 2 seemed to be confused about the splitting lines up rule, but was grouping the lines properly.

# Day 4
The easiest one this year IMHO. GPT Chat had almost no problem solving it as well.

# Day 5
Definitely trickier than yesterday, mostly on the parsing part. Once I had the arrays it was pretty simple. Parsing could have been pretty fast if I'd just gone column by column based on the char x, ys, rather than using the column identifiers.

# Day 6
First part was easy. Then I must have made a mistake copying the sample, and I had the right solution but it wouldn't match the expected sample output.

# Day 7
The pre-parsing of commands was a waste - I just parsed them so I could unpack them later. Same with saving the individual files and sizes, although you never know on Part 2!

# Day 8
That was just much harder than it should have been. At least my parse through neighbors code was pretty reusable.

# Day 9
This took way too long for Part 2. In the end, I was being way too tricky and I was missing some diagonal casees.

# Day 10
Intcode v2? My Part 2 had some bug printing the first line but it was legible enough to get the answer.

# Day 11
I really need to look up how Python class types work.

# Day 12
I solved P1 pretty fast, and I was on a good track for P2 I think, but I got stuck on the conditional for going down. I needed to it to be just paths that involved jumps of 0/1, but I had the wrong conditions.
