Day 1.
* Site went down, couldn't get input for about 7 mins.
* Did all my work in the template instead of 1.py. Otherwise the template worked pretty well.
* Forgot to parse the items as ints!
* Didn't switch logic over to the part2() function, so it was failing the assert.
* Didn't do a day1 branch.

Tomorrow:
* Get a day2 branch 2part1.py, 2part2.py 2.txt, 2.sample files ready in the other panes for easy pasting and reference.
* Get a command to git add the part 1 ready.
* Grab input first thing next time in case.
