Day 1.
* Site went down, couldn't get input for about 7 mins.
* Did all my work in the template instead of 1.py. Otherwise the template worked pretty well.
* Forgot to parse the items as ints!
* Didn't switch logic over to the part2() function, so it was failing the assert.
* Didn't do a day1 branch.

Day 2:
* Pretty straightforward.
* Separate windows and files worked smoothly.
* Parsing was more complicated than necessary.
* ^ for XOR :)

Day 3:
* Forgot that the pattern repeated across.
* Got stuck on wrong sample - copied the ones with X and Os filled in for trees and misses, not the top one.
* Over complicated loop instead of just multiplying the output of all the funcs.

Every Day Plan:
* Get a dayX branch X.part1.py, X.part2.py X.txt, X.sample files ready in the other panes for easy pasting and reference.
* Grab input first thing next time in case.
