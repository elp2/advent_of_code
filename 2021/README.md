# Day 1

Simple, straightforward.

# Day 2

Lost time on part 1 when I flipped the down/up effect on depth. Otherwise simple.

# Day 3

Pretty simple, with proper, non buggy list comprehension.

# Day 4

Worked better when I broke out the solving / scoring into a separate function.

# Day 5

The parsing took a bit longer, and the delta took a bit longer than needed. But overall it was quickly adaptable to the second question.
